# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

This repository contains a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for financial valuation. DCF is a widely-used method to estimate the intrinsic value of an asset by discounting future cash flows to their present value. This model is intended for educational purposes and should not be considered financial advice.

## Overview

The DCF model takes into account the following parameters:

1. **Projected Cash Flows:** Estimate future cash flows for a specified period, typically 5 to 10 years. These can include revenue, operating expenses, taxes, and capital expenditures.

2. **Discount Rate (Cost of Capital):** The rate used to discount future cash flows back to their present value. It reflects the required return or cost of funding for the investment.

3. **Terminal Value:** An estimate of the value of cash flows beyond the projection period. Commonly calculated using the perpetuity growth model or exit multiple approach.

## Calculation Steps

1. **Forecast Period Cash Flows:** Estimate cash flows for each period in the projection timeline based on financial data and assumptions.

2. **Discounting Cash Flows:** Apply the discount rate to each projected cash flow to calculate its present value. Sum these present values to get the total present value of forecasted cash flows.

3. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using an appropriate method and discount it back to present value.

4. **Total Enterprise Value:** Sum the present value of forecasted cash flows and the present value of the terminal value to get the total enterprise value.

5. **Equity Value:** Subtract net debt or other liabilities to obtain the equity value.

## Disclaimer

The DCF model's accuracy heavily depends on assumptions and input data quality. It should be used cautiously and in conjunction with other valuation methods. This model does not provide any guarantee of accuracy or financial outcomes. It is advisable to seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.
